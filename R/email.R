########################################################



## I need to send emails to Carl, new/older authors, as well as
## prospective authors.  These should all be functions if for no other
## reason than to allow their contents to be edited by all team
## members via svn.

####################################################################
## lets start with a function to send an email when the user already
## has a svn account.

## This just gets the contents for the Maintainer field
## (There might be multiple emails returned from here)
.extractEmails <- function(dir){
    dirPath <- file.path(dir, "DESCRIPTION")
    DESC <- read.dcf(dirPath)
    rawEmail <- DESC[,grepl("Maintainer",colnames(DESC)),drop=FALSE]
    ## if there are multiples, clean them up
    emails <- unlist(strsplit(rawEmail, "> ?"))
    ## remove newlines and reattach ">'s", then return character() 
    emails <- paste(sub("\n"," ", emails),">",sep="")
    ## remove commas with whitespace after, and also lonely commas,
    emails <- sub("^\\s+?","",sub(",","",emails),perl=TRUE)
    ## and make sure we have only one whitespace followed by < before email 
    sub("<"," <",sub("\\s+?<","<",emails))
}

## This just extracts email adresses from a Maintainer field.
.scrubOutEmailAddresses <-function(rawEmail){
    as.character(sub(">$","",sub("^.*<","", rawEmail)))
}

## This just extracts names from a Maintainer field
.scrubOutNamesFromEmails <-function(rawEmail){
    names <- sub("\\s.?<.*$","", rawEmail, perl=TRUE)
    sub(",","",sub(", ","", names))
}

## Email wrapper so that I don't have to do this more than once
## NOTE: for sendmailR (or even command line mail) to run, you must
## have set /etc/mailname.  Mine was set to: gamay.fhcrc.org
.sendEmailMessage <- function(email, msg, subject){
    require("sendmailR")
    fromEmail = getOption("fromEmail")
    sendmail(from=fromEmail, to=email,
             subject=subject, msg=msg)
}

## And for when we want to send multiple messages:
.sendEmailMessages <- function(emails, msgs, subject){
    for(i in seq_along(emails)){
        .sendEmailMessage(emails[i], msgs[i], subject)
    }
}

## and code to define a single message template
.makeExistingUserMsg <- function(authorName, packageName){
    existingMsg <- paste(
                         "Hi ",
                         authorName,
                     ",
Your package has been added to the Bioconductor repository. 
Some helpful notes to help you as a package maintainer: 

a) svn information 
Your Subversion account information is the same as before, but
permissions have now been extended to your new package
You now have read/write access to the ",packageName," package:
URL: https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/",packageName,"
Please let me know if you have any question or problem with your svn
access.
svn docs at: http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/source-control/

b) Build report: 
Please  keep an eye on the build/check daily reports for the 
Bioconductor devel packages:  http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/
and get rid of any warnings and errors for your package. 

c) RSS Feeds:
You can find the rss feed for your software packages at:
http://bioconductor.org/rss/build/packages/",packageName,".rss

d) Stay connected using Bioc-devel mailing list and support site
http://bioconductor.org/help/support/#bioc-devel

e) Git svn bridge
if you prefer to use git and Github instead of Subversion, you can
use the Bioconductor Git-svn bridge which is documented at:
http://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git-svn/

f) add maintainer or removal of package from Bioconductor:
Please email us at packages NEAR bioconductor POINT org with your requests
for new mainatiners, please clearly state their name and email address
and mark them a cc on the request email sento us. 

g) Permanent URL of your package.
Your package has a permanent URL:

http://bioconductor.org/packages/",packageName,"/

This will redirect to the release landing page of your package
(and until it's released, the devel landing page). Therefore this
is the URL that should be used (in publications, etc.) to refer
to your package. For convenience, you can also refer specifically to 
the devel version, the release version, or a specific numbered
version of Bioconductor:

http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/",packageName,"/
http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/",packageName,"/
http://bioconductor.org/packages/",BiocInstaller:::BIOC_VERSION,"/",packageName,"/


Thanks for contributing to the Bioconductor project!

Congrats on your package being accepted to Bioconductor.  The following 
information is to help you in your new role as a package maintainer.

Every package in Bioconductor gets its own landing page. Contents from your 
DESCRIPTION file are pulled out to populate this page. Your package's 
permanent URL is:  http://bioconductor.org/packages/<pkgname>/

This will redirect to the release landing page of your package (and 
until it's released, the devel landing page). Therefore this is the 
URL that should be used (in publications, etc.) to refer to your package. 
For convenience, you can also refer specifically to the devel version, 
the release version, or a specific numbered version of Bioconductor:

http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/<packageName>/
http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/<packageName>/
http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.2/<packageName>/

Maintaining your package: 

1) Git- svn bridge 
If you prefer to use git and Github instead of Subversion, you can use the 
Bioconductor Git-svn bridge which is documented at: 
http://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git-svn/

2) Build report:
Please  keep an eye on the build/check daily reports for the Bioconductor 
devel packages:  http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/ and get rid of any 
warnings or errors from your packages build report. 

3) Rss feeds:
You can find the rss feed for software packages at: 
http://bioconductor.org/rss/build/packages/<pkgname>.rss

4) Bioc-devel mailing list 
Our primary channel is the Bioc-devel mailing list which we use for 
communication between developers and for important announcements like 
release schedules, build system news, etc.. which you have signed up for. 
Please check this email on a regular basis. 

Also, when your package will pass the CHECK test for the first time, we 
strongly encourage you to send a note to Bioc-devel to announce its 
public availability (with a short description) so other people  can 
start to test it.

5) Adding Maintainers for your package:
If for some reason, your email address changes, please update the 
maintainer field in your description file. We may need to reach you 
if there are issues building your package (this could happen as a 
result of changes to R or to packages you depend on). If we can't 
reach you, we may have to drop your package from Bioconductor.  

If you want to add a new mainatiner or transfer responsibility to a
someone else,  please email us at packages NEAR bioconductor POINT org
and clearly state the new maintainers name and email address. Also 
mark him a cc on this email 

6) Support Site:
Please also subscribe to the bioconductor support site so that you can 
answer questions from users of your package and respond to bug reports 
promptly. https://support.bioconductor.org/ 
We recommend that you 'follow' tags that match your own package (such 
as your package name) so that you will know be able to know when someone is 
asking a question about your package or that relates to your work.  You 
can edit your profile on the support site to be notified when certain tags 
are used to describe your package.

7) Removal of your package:
If you no longer want to maintain your package, please let us know and we 
will remove it from Bioconductor, or (with your permission) find a new 
maintainer for it.

8) Updating your package in Bioconductor: 
You will need to use subversion to update your package inside Bioconductor. 
Your subversion account credentials are . 



Subversion user ID:
Password:



These credentials give you read access to the whole Bioconductor 
repository and WRITE permissions only to your package.
To update your package you need to do the following steps:
a) install subversion(svn) on your machine, if you dont have that already
You can learn about svn from here: http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/source-control/
b) svn co --username your_name 
https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/pkgName
You will be prompted for a password  - This will create a folder for your package.
c) make the changes you need to make to your package.
d) bump the version from x.y.z to x.y.(z+1) in the DESCRIPTION file (DON'T FORGET TO
BUMP Z! or your changes will not be pushed to the public repository.)
e) R CMD build packageName
f) R cmd check pkganme_x.y.(z+1).tar.gz
g) Fix any warnings/ errors from step (e) and (f)
h) svn ci pkgname
Please let me know if you have any question or problem with your svn access.
